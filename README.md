# OnlineBusinessSystems

This project was created at the VanHack São Paulo Mission Hackaton for the company Online Business Systems.

This system manages storage of farm in one single page, the user can add a new storage and set what kind of product is stored and how much of it is in each storage. 

The dashboard shows the current storage capacities. 

By editing the storage the user can change the amount of product on the storage, the name of the storage and change what product is stored in.

For future implementations, I would add a management for the transport, providing a log for every product that is added or withdraw from the storage.
